Beginner Excel project that I followed along with on YouTube. 

Cleaned data by deleting duplicates, correctly formatting and validating raw data. Analyzed, summarized, and found data patterns with the use of Pivot tables. 
Generated interactive visualizations to easily make comparisons between multiple variables.
